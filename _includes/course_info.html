        <h3>Textbook</h3>
        <p>
          The textbook for this course is <a href="http://www.gamedesignworkshop.com/">Game Design Workshop: A Playcentric Approach to Creating Innovative Games</a> by Tracy Fullerton.
          I have the <span class="bold">2nd Edition</span> so feel free to get that version. It can be found in a few places:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Design-Workshop-Playcentric-Innovative/dp/0240809742">amazon.com (as low as $14 used)</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.chegg.com/etextbooks/game-design-workshop-2nd-edition-9780080560397-0080560393">chegg.com ($18 for a 90-day eTextbook rental)</a></li>
          <li>If you know of another good place to buy the book, either digitially or physically, please let me know!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Class Engine</h3>
        <p>
          We will be learning and using <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Engine</a> in this course.
        </p>

        <h3>Lab Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Due to a few factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>UE4 is not yet installed on the lab machines.</li>
          <li>UE4 is kind of a pain to use on smaller screens, being much better on a desktop or especially multiple monitors.</li>
          <li>UE4 projects that include starter content take up more than 1GB of space, making it difficult to synchronize work with tools like Github.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I'll let anyone who wants to work on the lab assignments at home do so.
          Lab will continue to be a place for you to get help on assignments and work with other students if you want to.
          To turn in lab assignments that you work on at home, just email me a screenshot or two at <a href="mailto:idunn01@calpoly.edu">idunn01@calpoly.edu</a>.
          Just show as many parts of the lab as you can in a couple of screenshots.
          Lab screenshots are due by 11:59pm on the day the assignment is due.
        </p>
