## Exercise 2.1: Think of a Game

1.  Think of a game, any game. Now write down a
    description of the game. Be detailed. Describe it
    as if to someone who has never played a game
    like it before.
2.  Now think of another game - a completely different type of game. The more different this game is
    from the first one, the better. Describe it.
3.  Compare your descriptions. Which elements were
    different and which were similar? Dig deep and
    really think about the underlying mechanics of
    each game.

There is no wrong answer to this exercise. The goal
is simply to get you to begin thinking about the nature
of games and to realize that games, no matter how
dissimilar they might seem, do share some common
elements. Those common elements are why we recognize certain experiences, and not others, as games,
and throughout this book they will form the basis for
our study of games and game design.

## Can't Think of a Game?

If you can't think of a game or two to write about, don't buy one.
Just play one of these free online games:

- [Winterbells (or any of the other Orisinal games)](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm)
- [Spybot: The Nightfall Incident](http://jayisgames.com/games/spybot-the-nightfall-incident/)
- [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)
- [Agar.io](http://agar.io/)
- [Slither.io](http://slither.io/)
- [Flappy Bird](http://flappybird.io/)
- [HexGL](http://hexgl.bkcore.com/)

You don't need to beat the games or play them a lot - you just need to be able to describe the core mechanics of the game.
