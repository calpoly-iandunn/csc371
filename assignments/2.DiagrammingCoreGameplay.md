From *Game Design Workshop* pg. 189.

The exercise from the book is below.

## Exercise 7.7: Diagramming Core Gameplay 1

Choose two games that you know, write a short description of their core gameplay, and then sketch a visualization of it.

## Details

Since I am asking for a sketch, I'll let you submit it a number of ways.

- If you want to draw out the diagram using software, then submit and image or PDF on Polylearn.
- If your diagram is on paper, you can scan or photograph it and upload that image to Polylearn.
- Or, you can just hand in your diagram on paper to me in office hours or after class on any day.
  If you choose this option, however, your deadline is now 5:00pm on the duedate instead of the 11:59pm PolyLearn deadline (since I must be physically present for you to turn in).

Similarly, you can choose to submit your short descriptions either as raw text on polylearn, an attachment, or on paper.

If you're wondering what I'm looking for in terms of diagrams, look at Figures 7.10 and 7.11 in the book, around the same page as the exercise.
These are perfect examples of a good gameplay diagram.

Submit your responses to the assignment [on PolyLearn](https://polylearn.calpoly.edu/AY_2016-2017/mod/assign/view.php?id=368352).

Keep your short descriptions of the core gameplay *short*.
I want a one sentence description.
Look at how the author describes *WarCraft*, *Monopoly*, etc. on pg. 189.
This is the level of detail that I want.
If you decide to do one of the games the author mentions here, feel free to use her description.

## Can't Think of a Game?

If you can't think of a game or two to write about, don't buy one.
Just play some of these free online games:

- [Winterbells (or any of the other Orisinal games)](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm)
- [Spybot: The Nightfall Incident](http://jayisgames.com/games/spybot-the-nightfall-incident/)
- [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)
- [Agar.io](http://agar.io/)
- [Slither.io](http://slither.io/)
- [Flappy Bird](http://flappybird.io/)
- [HexGL](http://hexgl.bkcore.com/)

You don't need to beat the games or play them a lot - you just need to be able to diagram the core mechanics of the game.
