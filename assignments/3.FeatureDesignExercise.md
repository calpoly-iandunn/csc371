From *Game Design Workshop* pg. 165, 168.

The exercise from the book is below.

## Exercise 6.9, 6.10: Feature Design Exercise

> Think of a feature you would like to see added to one of your favorite games.
> I am sure you have plenty of ideas on this one.
> It does not matter how far-fetched or technically difficult the idea is at first because
> you are not going to actually build it.
> Rather you are going to illustrate how it works using storyboards and words.

> Create a visual storyboard stepping through the use of the feature idea.
> Assemble the storyboard so that it tells a visual story of a player successfully playing the game.
> For example, the storyboard for Karaoke Revolution World Party could show all of the interfaces as if a
> player starts as a beginner and moves all the way to winning a prize.

## Details

Since I am asking for a visual storyboard, I'll let you submit it a number of ways.

- If you want to draw out the storyboard using software, then submit an image or PDF on Polylearn.
- If your storyboard is on paper, you can scan or photograph it and upload that image to Polylearn.
- Or, you can just hand in your storyboard on paper to me in office hours or after class on any day.
  If you choose this option, however, your deadline is now 4:00pm on the duedate instead of the 11:59pm PolyLearn deadline (since I must be physically present for you to turn in).

For more information on what your storyboard should look like, check the figures on pg. 165 in the book:

and the description on pg. 168:

> The most powerful way to explain your ideas for new features is to visualize them.
> You can use Photoshop or any other image editing program you have access to.
> A good way to begin is to use screenshots from the existing game
> and edit them to explain what the player sees when they use your new feature ideas.
> For example, show how the feature starts (e.g., exactly what the player sees on the screen when the feature is activated)
> and how the interface changes as the player manipulates the controls to use the feature.
> Show a series of still images — each with a slightly different on-screen condition —
> to simulate a player moving through the game using the feature.
> Storyboards like this can include dozens of still images — each just incrementally different than its predecessor —
> to show exactly how the feature works.
> Do not worry if you have poor art skills.
> The goal is not for the graphics to look perfect but rather to communicate your ideas with simple imagery.
> Assemble the storyboard and add some light explanatory text.
> You can assemble the storyboard using presentation programs such as PowerPoint or Keynote.
> These programs make it easy for you to put together a long series of images and add light text.
> Do not put much text on the images because you want your ideas to be communicated visually.

I am looking for one to three images like what you see on pg. 165.
