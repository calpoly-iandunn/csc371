From *Game Design Workshop* pg. 165, 168.

The exercise from the book is below.

## Exercise 6.9, 6.10: Feature Design Exercise

Think of a feature you would like to see added to one of your favorite games.
I am sure you have plenty of ideas on this one.
It does not matter how far-fetched or technically difficult the idea is at first because
you are not going to actually build it.
Rather you are going to illustrate how it works using storyboards and words.

Create a visual storyboard stepping through the use of the feature idea.
Assemble the storyboard so that it tells a visual story of a player successfully playing the game.
For example, the storyboard for Karaoke Revolution World Party could show all of the interfaces as if a
player starts as a beginner and moves all the way to winning a prize.

## Details

Since I am asking for a visual storyboard, I'll let you submit it a number of ways.

- If you want to draw out the diagram using software, then submit and image or PDF on Polylearn.
- If your diagram is on paper, you can scan or photograph it and upload that image to Polylearn.
- Or, you can just hand in your diagram on paper to me in office hours or after class on any day.
  If you choose this option, however, your deadline is now 5:00pm on the duedate instead of the 11:59pm PolyLearn deadline (since I must be physically present for you to turn in).

Similarly, you can choose to submit your short descriptions either as raw text on polylearn, an attachment, or on paper.

If you're wondering what I'm looking for in terms of diagrams, look at Figure 6.5 in the book, around the same page as the exercise.

Submit your responses to the assignment [on PolyLearn](#).

## Can't Think of a Game?

If you can't think of a game or two to write about, don't buy one.
Just play some of these free online games:

- [Winterbells (or any of the other Orisinal games)](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm)
- [Spybot: The Nightfall Incident](http://jayisgames.com/games/spybot-the-nightfall-incident/)
