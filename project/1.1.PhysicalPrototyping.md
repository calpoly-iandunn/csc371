On Wednesday 4/12 and Friday 4/14 we will be doing physical prototyping.
On Monday we will do more testing and refinement, then playtesting each other's prototypes.

## Writeup

I want each team to submit a writeup describing their physical prototype.
You writeup should include:

* List of **player experience goals** for your board game (see p. 10-11 in the book)
* **Prototype Construction Details**
  * Description of your construction - what pieces did you use to represent your game, and what did that representation look like.
  * Description of your foundational rules.
  * A list of rules that you tried
    * For each rule: explain the rule, how it worked when you tried it, and whether you decided to keep it.
    * I really want to see a solid explanation of how you iterated on your design.
* **Playesting Details**
  * Some thoughts on how your prototype stood up to playtesting - how did people (outside your team) respond when they played it.
    * In particular, I'd like to see a list of things your playtesters were confused about, and any thoughts they had on how different features played out.

I'm looking for at least a few pages here.
Be descriptive!

I recommend using Google Docs or a similar platform so that everyone on the team can contribute easily.

Please send your writeup to me via email.
Plain text, an attachment, or a link to the document are all fine.
See the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/) page for the due date and rubric link.
