title: "Project Deliverable 1 - Physical Prototyping"
---

On Friday 1/20 and Monday 1/23 we will be doing physical prototyping.
On Friday you will be constructing and doing some prelimiary testing on your prototypes.
On Monday we will do more testing and refinement.

After this I want each team to submit a writeup describing their physical prototype.
You writeup should include:

* Description of your construction - what pieces did you use to represent your game, and what did that representation look like.
* Description of your foundational rules.
* A list of rules that you tried
  * For each rule: explain the rule, how it worked when you tried it, and whether you decided to keep it.
* Some thoughts on how your prototype stood up to playtesting - how did people (outside your team) respond when they played it.

I'm looking for at least a few pages here.
Be descriptive!

I recommend using Google Docs or a similar platform so that everyone on the team can contribute easily.

Please send your writeup to me via email.
