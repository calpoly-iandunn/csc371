title: "Project Deliverable 4 - Sprint 1"
---

You have two options for this first sprint of project development.

## Option 1 - Return To Physical Prototype

You can return to your physicaly prototype to iterate on your design, add and playtest additional features.

## Option 2 - Iterate On Your UE4 Implementation

Build on your digital prototype to start fleshing out your game.

## Deviverables

The deliverable for this project milestone consists of two parts (and the structure for each consecutive sprint will be mostly the same):

### 1. Demo

On the due date, you will need to demonstrate your progress in lab.
Mostly I would like to see playable demos!

### 2. Project Management

I want you to use a project management system to assign and track work on your project.
The issue trackers built in to [Github](https://github.com/) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) are both excellent choices for this.
You can also use [Trello](https://trello.com/) if you prefer.
Any other reasonable issue tracking software is allowable assuming that I am able to access and use it.
Please let me know if you plan to use software other than the three above recommendations.
