On Monday 4/24 we will work on board game production, then playtesting each other's prototypes on Wednesday 4/26.

## Writeup

I want each team to submit a writeup describing their production phase.
You writeup should include:

* **Production Details**
  * Any changes you have made to the game since your physical prototype.
  * Any changes in mechanics? Rules?
  * Additional content including cards or units (e.g. Features)?
* **Playesting Details**
  * A list of at least a few questions you prepared for your production playtest session (see p. 263 in the book)
* **Project Wrapup**
  * What changes would you make if you had more time?
  * Anything you wish you had done differently from the start?

I'm looking for at least a couple of pages here.
Be descriptive!

I recommend using Google Docs or a similar platform so that everyone on the team can contribute easily.

Please send your writeup to me via email.
Plain text, an attachment, or a link to the document are all fine.
See the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/) page for the due date and rubric link.
