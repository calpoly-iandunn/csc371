<span class="text-danger">**This spec is not yet complete**</span>

On Wednesday 4/12 and Friday 4/14 we will be doing physical prototyping.
On Monday we will do more testing and refinement, then playtesting each other's prototypes.

## Writeup

I want each team to submit a writeup describing their physical prototype.
You writeup should include:

* **Playesting Details**
  * A list of at least a few questions you prepared for your production playtest session (see p. 263 in the book)

I'm looking for at least a few pages here.
Be descriptive!

I recommend using Google Docs or a similar platform so that everyone on the team can contribute easily.

Please send your writeup to me via email.
Plain text, an attachment, or a link to the document are all fine.
See the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/) page for the due date and rubric link.
