In class we will be doing production prototpying of our board games.
On Monday 4/24 we will work on board game production, then playtesting each other's prototypes on Wednesday 4/26.

## Writeup

I want each team to submit a writeup describing their production phase.
I'm looking for at least a few pages here.
Be descriptive!


### Rubric

* Any changes you have made to the game since your physical prototype.

</td>

<td markdown="block">

</td>

## Hand-in

I recommend using Google Docs or a similar platform so that everyone on the team can contribute easily.

Please send your writeup to me via email, or give me read access (share it) if it's on a platform like Google Docs.
Plain text, an attachment, or a link to the document are all fine.
See the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/) page for the due date.
