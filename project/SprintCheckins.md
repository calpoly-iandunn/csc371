On sprint deadline days I want to meet with each team individually to discuss current progress, the completed and incomplete tasks for that sprint, and the goals going forward.
I want to allow up to 10 minutes with each team, so checkins will occur in both lecture and lab period.
We have ten teams, two 50 minute class periods, it should all work out.

At the start of class I will set out a sign-up sheet for teams to reserve a 10-minute slot.
I'm hoping to keep every check-in under 10 minutes so that it is easy to stick to the schedule.
