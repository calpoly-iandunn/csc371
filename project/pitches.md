This time is for all of you to seek additional team members.

- If you’ve already formed a team and don’t need more people, you don’t have to pitch.
- If you have some idea you want to work on and need people, you can pitch that.
- If you have a group, some general idea and want more people, you can just announce that.

If you want to make a slide deck to present your game idea, go ahead and do that!

By the end of the day in lab you should all be in your teams and have a plan for what game you want to work on.
It is perfectly fine if your game idea changes over the quarter - that's part of iterative development!
