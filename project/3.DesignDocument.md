## Requirements

The design document is Phase 3 of the prototyping process.
Refer to Chapter 14 in your book for details on Design Documents.
It has a lot more guidance and details than writeup.

Looking at the outline on pages 396 through 399, I would like to see the following sections **if relevant**.

1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

In other words, if the book mentions something I would like to see it in your document *EXCEPT* I don't need to see Legal Analysis or Technical Spec.

I realize that some sections will be small and others larger, depending on the scope and aspects of your games.
Maybe your character section is really long, or maybe your game hardly has characters.
I want to see all the above sections in your document, but I leave it up to you where you invest the majority of your detail.
Itâ€™s fine to put medium detail in all sections, or a lot of detail and effort in the most relevant sections.

## The Document

Your design document should be a living document.
While I expect you to have a "complete" version for me to view on the due date, it in no way needs to be a "final" version.
Later project milestones will ask you to make sure that your design document remains up-to-date.

If you to add something to the document that is not in the requirements or the books outline, please feel free to!

## Examples

A few places you can find examples of Industry GDDs:

* [http://stemchallenge.org/resources/game-design-documents/](http://stemchallenge.org/resources/game-design-documents/)
* [http://seriousgamesnet.eu/assets/view/238](http://seriousgamesnet.eu/assets/view/238)
* Let me know if you find other good examples, especially from games you are interested in!

## Wiki

I want everyone to use a wiki to write their document.
Which wiki solution you use is up to you.

One of the easiest solutions is to create a [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) repository - they both allow you to create and edit a wiki.

## Deliverables

All I need is a link to your Game Design Document wiki emailed to me by one of your teammates.
Make sure that it is readable by me!

You can send a link to me before your design document is complete for grading purposes - I will just make sure that the link is working.

The document is due Wednesday 2/15 by 11:59:59pm.
