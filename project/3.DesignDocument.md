title: "Project Deliverable 3 - Design Document"
---

The design document is Phase 3 of the prototyping process.
Refer to Chapter 14 in your book for details on Design Documents.
It has a lot more guidance and details than writeup.

Your design document should be a living document.
While I expect you to have a "complete" version for me to view on the due date, it in no way needs to be a "final" version.
Later project milestones will ask you to make sure that your design document remains up-to-date.

## Examples

A few places you can find examples of Industry GDDs:

* [http://stemchallenge.org/resources/game-design-documents/](http://stemchallenge.org/resources/game-design-documents/)
* [http://seriousgamesnet.eu/assets/view/238](http://seriousgamesnet.eu/assets/view/238)
* Let me know if you find other good examples, especially from games you are interested in!

## Wiki

I want everyone to use a wiki to write their document.
Which wiki solution you use is up to you.

One of the easiest solutions is to create a [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) repository - they both allow you to create and edit a wiki.

## Deliverables

All I need is a link to your Game Design Document wiki emailed to me by one of your teammates.
Make sure that it is readable by me!

You can send a link to me before your design document is complete for grading purposes - I will just make sure that the link is working.

The document is due Wednesday 2/15 by 11:59:59pm.
