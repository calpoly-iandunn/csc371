title: Team Evaluation
---

At the end of the quarter, each member of teach team will be asked to fill out a survey evaluating their fellow teammates.
You will be asked to evaluate the contributions of your teammates.

The purpose of this evaluation is to make sure that grading for the final project is fair.
I don't want any one or more students to pull most of the weight on the project and not have that reflected in your final grade.

The evaluation survey is required (worth 10 points on your project grade) and must be completed by Friday of Finals Week.
