## Project 1: Physical Game

Work in teams of 1-6 to create a physical game such as a board game or trading-card game.
In this project we will consider some of the more pure aspects of game design, doing lots of prototyping and playtesting.
The advantage of a physical game is that the iteration time in terms of making design changes can be quite short.
When making digital games, you acquire a lot of technical debt and there can be huge development hurdles when making changes.

1. [Physical Prototyping](1/1/) due Monday 4/24.

2. [Production](1/2/) due Monday 5/1.



## Project 2: Digital Game

Work in teams of 2-6 to create a digital game using Unity.

### Deliverables:

1. [Physical Prototyping](2/1/) due Wednesday 5/10.

2. [Software Prototyping](2/2/) due Friday 5/19.

3. [Production](2/3/) (completed in four sprints with individual due-dates).

4. [Design Document](2/4/) due Friday 6/9.

5. [Team Evaluations](2/5/) due Wednesday 6/14.
