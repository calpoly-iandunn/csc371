## Project 1: Physical Game

Work in teams of 1-6 to create a physical game such as a board game or trading-card game.
In this project we will consider some of the more pure aspects of game design, doing lots of prototyping and playtesting.
The advantage of a physical game is that the iteration time in terms of making design changes can be quite short.
When making digital games, you acquire a lot of technical debt and there can be huge development hurdles when making changes.


## Project 2: Unreal Engine Game

Work in teams of 2-6 to create a digital game using Unreal Engine.
Note that UnrealEngine is particularly suited to making certain types of games, such as action-adventure games and FPSs.
It can be tricky to make things like puzzle games using Blueprints.
