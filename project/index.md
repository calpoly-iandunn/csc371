## Project 1: Physical Game

Work in teams of 1-6 to create a physical/conventional game such as a board game or trading-card game.

In this project we will consider some of the more pure aspects of game design, doing lots of prototyping and playtesting.
The advantage of a physical game is that the iteration time in terms of making design changes can be quite short.
When making digital games, you acquire a lot of technical debt and there can be huge development hurdles when making changes.

1. [Prototyping](physical/1/) due Monday 4/24.

2. [Production](physical/2/) due Monday 5/1.



## Project 2: Digital Game

Work in teams of 2-6 to create a digital game using Unity.

Once our conventional games are complete, we will move on to digital games.
Digital games often have a more complicated development process,
as both the gameplay aspects as well as the technology must be implemented.

### Deliverables:

1. [Physical Prototyping](digital/1/) due Wednesday 5/10.

2. [Software Prototyping](digital/2/) due Friday 5/19.

3. [Production](digital/3/) (completed in four sprints with individual due-dates).

4. [Design Document](digital/4/) due Friday 6/9.

5. [Team Evaluations](digital/5/) due Wednesday 6/14.
