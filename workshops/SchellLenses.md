## Introduction

*The Art of Game Design* by Jesse Schell was almost the textbook for this course.
It's a great book to have if you're planning to pursue a career in Game Design.
It is organized as a series of "lenses" through which to think about your game.

## Workshop

I want you to use some of the lenses from the book to analyze the games you are building for this class.
Working with your groups, answer the questions posed by each of the lenses below.
I am more interested in fostering a discussion about your game than forcing you to write an essay,
but I would still like to see some written responses summarizing your thoughts and perspectives.
In particular, I'd like to hear if your perspective or plan for the game was changed by this workshop.
