## Introduction

*The Art of Game Design* by Jesse Schell was almost the textbook for this course.
It's a great book to have if you're planning to pursue a career in Game Design.
It is organized as a series of "lenses" through which to think about your game.

Depending on your responses to this workshop we might do it again with a different set of lenses (hence the "1" in the title).
There are 100 lenses in the book.

## Workshop

I want you to use some of the lenses from the book to analyze the games you are building for this class.
Working with your groups, answer the questions posed by each of the lenses below.
I am more interested in fostering a discussion about your game than forcing you to write an essay,
but I would still like to see some written responses summarizing your thoughts and perspectives.
In particular, I'd like to hear if your perspective or plan for the game was changed by this workshop.

## Lenses

### Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience

To use this lens, you stop thinking about your game and start thinking about
the experience of the player. Ask yourself these questions:

- What experience do I want the player to have?
- What is essential to that experience?
- How can my game capture that essence?

If there is a big difference between the experience you want to create and the
one you are actually creating, your game needs to change: You need to clearly
state the essential experience you desire, and find as many ways as possible to
instill this essence into your game.

### Lens #2: The Lens of Surprise

Surprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it. Use this lens to remind
yourself to fill your game with interesting surprises. Ask yourself these questions:

- What will surprise players when they play my game?
- Does the story in my game have surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?
- Do your rules give players ways to surprise each other?
- Do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?

Surprise is a crucial part of all entertainment — it is at the root of humor,
strategy, and problem solving. Our brains are hardwired to enjoy surprises.
In an experiment where participants received sprays of sugar water or plain
water into their mouths, the participants who received random sprays consid-
ered the experience much more pleasurable than participants who received
the sprays according to a fixed pattern, even though the same amount of sugar
was delivered. In other experiments, brain scans revealed that even during
unpleasant surprises, the pleasure centers of the brain are triggered.

### Lens #3: The Lens of Fun

Fun is desirable in nearly every game, although sometimes fun defies analysis.
To maximize your game’s fun, ask yourself these questions:

- What parts of my game are fun? Why?
- What parts need to be more fun?

### Lens #4: The Lens of Curiosity
To use this lens, think about the player’s true motivations — not just the goals
your game has set forth, but the reason the player wants to achieve those
goals. Ask yourself these questions:

- What questions does my game put into the player’s mind?
- What am I doing to make them care about these questions?
- What can I do to make them invent even more questions?

For example, a maze-finding videogame might have a time-limit goal such that
at each level, players are trying to answer the question: “Can I find my way
through this maze in 30 seconds? ” A way to make them care more would be
to play interesting animations when they solve each maze, so players might
also ask the question: “I wonder what the next animation will be? ”

### Lens #5: The Lens of Endogenous Value
To use this lens, think about your players’ feelings about items, objects, and
scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:

- What is valuable to the players in my game?
- How can I make it more valuable to them?
- What is the relationship between value in the game and the player’s motivations?

Remember, the value of the items and score in the game is a direct reflection
of how much players care about succeeding in your game. By thinking about
what the players really care about and why, you can often get insights about
how your game can improve.
