## Introduction

This workshop is built from exercises in *Game Design Workshop* and some lenses from *The Art of Game Design*.

## Questions

### Game Variables
List out the game variables in the game prototype you have been working on.
Does a change in one variable and affect other variables?
Can you make easy, medium, and hard levels simply by tweaking the variables?
What about easy, medium, and hard "skill levels" built into the game that the player can choose.

### Reinforcing Relationships
Analyze your game prototype for reinforcing relationships.
Is it common for the player who gets an early lead to win the game?
If so, you might have a reinforcing relationship that is creating an imbalance in the system.
Identify the issue and discuss changes to the relationship that might balance the play.

### Dominant Strategy
In your game, can you identify a dominant strategy that limits player choice?
If you cannot find one, list out some strategies that do work.
What are the opposing strategies that players can utilize?

### Symmetrical versus Asymmetrical Games
Is your original game prototype symmetrical or asymmetrical?
Describe how and why.

### Asymmetrical Objectives
Take the game prototype you have developed and create a variant with asymmetrical objectives, unless your game already makes use of them.
If your game is a single player game, consider a choice of objectives.
Describe how this might affect your gameplay.

### Lens #27: The Lens of Skill
To use this lens, stop looking at your game, and start looking at the skills you are asking of your players.
Ask yourself these questions:

- What skills does my game require from the player?
- Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?
- Which skills are dominant?
- Are these skills creating the experience I want?
- Are some players much better at these skills than others? Does this make the game feel unfair?
- Can players improve their skills with practice?
- Does this game demand the right level of skill?

Exercising skills can be a joyful thing — it is one of the reasons that people love games.
Of course, it is only joyful if the skills are interesting and rewarding,
and if the challenge level strikes that ideal balance between “too easy" and “too hard.”
Even dull skills (such as pushing buttons) can be made more interesting by dressing them up as virtual skills
and providing the right level of challenge.
Use this lens as a window into the experience the player is having.
Because skills do so much to define experience, the Lens of Skill works quite well in conjunction with Lens #1: The Lens of Essential Experience.

### Lens #31: The Lens of Challenge
Challenge is at the core of almost all gameplay.
You could even say that a game is defined by its goals and its challenges.
When examining the challenges in your game, ask yourself these questions:

- What are the challenges in my game?
- Are they too easy, too hard, or just right?
- Can my challenges accommodate a wide variety of skill levels?
- How does the level of challenge increase as the player succeeds?
- Is there enough variety in the challenges?
- What is the maximum level of challenge in my game?
