Do the following tutorial.

[https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/QuickStart/index.html](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/QuickStart/index.html)

Notes:

* Step 4: The "Movement Capabilities" section you are looking for is under "Nav Movement" and needs to be expanded.
* Step 15: Under "Next Steps", only do the modification that uses a Dot Product to only chase the player when they are in front of the AI.
  You don't need to do the bonus or double bonus.

## Screenshots

If submitting this lab via screenshot, show me the Behaviour Tree and AgroCheck Blueprint.
I don't need to be able to see every pin - a zommed out view is fine.
