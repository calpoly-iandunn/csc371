In this lab we will be completing the first third or so of the [**2D Roguelike** tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-roguelike-tutorial).

You should be able to open up the template including all required assets on the **Learn** tab of the Unity startup window.

For Lab 4 we will complete these parts:

- [Player and Enemy Animations](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/player-and-enemy-animations?playlist=17150)
- [Creating the Tile Prefabs](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/creating-tile-prefabs?playlist=17150)
- [Writing the Board Manager](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/writing-board-manager?playlist=17150)
- [Writing the Game Manager](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/writing-game-manager?playlist=17150)

There is a lot going on in these videos so it will most likely be necessary to compelte the lab by playing the videos and following along.

I will outline as much as I can in the next few days, but mostly just to give an overview and maybe so that more experienced Unity developers can skip some videos.

## Player and Enemy Animations

### Create Player Prefab

- Create empty game object `Player`
- Find the spritesheet in included assets and expand it (right arrow)
- Click, Shift+Click to select the four idle frames and drag them onto the Player object
- Re-organize the created assets (AnimationController and Animation) into folders
- Do the same for player Chop and Hit animations
- Add box colider 2D and rigid Body 2D components to the player
  - Make Body Type **Kinematic**
- Set the Layer to **Blocking Layer**
- Set the Sorting Layer to **Units**
- Drag the Player into the Assets to make it a Prefab, then delete the original object


### Create Enemy Prefab

- Create Enemy1 Prefab
  - Tag: `Enemy`
  - Layer: `BlockingLayer`
  - Sorting Layer: `Units`
  - Enemy1 animation controller and Enemy1Idle and Enemy1Hit animations
- Create Enemy2 Prefab
  - Create Enemy2 Animation Override Controller using Enemy2Idle and Enemy2Hit animations

## Creating the Tile Prefabs

![Floor](Floor.png)

- Create Floor1 - Floor8 prefabs
  - Sprite Renderer component, no colliders
  - Sorting Layer: `Floor`

![Floor](Items.png)

- Create Exit, Food, Soda prefabs
  - Sorting Layer: `Items`
  - Box Collider 2D
    - Is Trigger: `true`
  - Tag: `Exit`, `Food`, `Soda`

![OuterWall](OuterWall.png)

- Create OuterWall1-3 prefabs
  - Box Collider 2D
    - Is Trigger: `false`
  - Tag: `Untagged`
  - Layer: `BlockingLayer`
  - Sorting Layer: `Floor`

![Wall](Wall.png)

- Create Wall1-8 prefabs
  - Box Collider 2D
    - Is Trigger: `false`
  - Tag: `Untagged`
  - Layer: `BlockingLayer`
  - Sorting Layer: `Items`

## Writing the Board Manager

- Write procedural board generation script in `BoardManager.cs`

## Writing the Game Manager

- Write board setup code in `GameManager.cs`
- Create GameManager prefab
  - Attach both manager scripts
  - Add all tile prefabs to Board Manager arrays
- Make GameManager a singleton
- Add a `Loader.cs` script that creates the GameManager, attach to **Main Camera**
