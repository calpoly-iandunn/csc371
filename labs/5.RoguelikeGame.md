Continue off of **Lab 4** for this assignment.

This lab assignment is a bit larger than previous labs because there's not really a good stopping point near the middle.
It will count for 1.5x the typical lab points.
Make sure to give enough time to complete it.

In this lab we will be completing the second two-thirds or so of the [**2D Roguelike** tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-roguelike-tutorial).

For **Lab 5** we will complete these parts:

- [Moving Object Script](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/moving-object-script?playlist=17150)
- [Creating Destructible Walls](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/creating-destructible-walls?playlist=17150)
- [Player Animator Controller](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/player-animator-controller?playlist=17150)
- [Writing the Player Script](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/writing-player-script?playlist=17150)
- [Writing the Enemy Script](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/writing-enemy-script?playlist=17150)
- [Enemy Animator Controller](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/enemy-animator-controller?playlist=17150)
- [Adding UI & Level Transitions](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial/adding-ui-level-transitions?playlist=17150)

There is a lot going on in these videos so it will most likely be necessary to compelte the lab by playing the videos and following along.

I will outline as much as I can, but mostly just to give an overview and maybe so that more experienced Unity developers can skip some parts of the videos.

## Moving Object Script

- Write an abstract class for moving objects

## Creating Destructible Walls

- Write the destructible wall script
- Select all 8 Wall prefabs and add the newly created Wall script to all of them
- Add the `DmgSprite` for each prefab using the damaged tiles in the tileset.
  - There are only 7 wall destruction tiles yet we have 8 prefabs
  - Use the 5th tile for both Wall5 and Wall6

## Player Animator Controller

- Add the `Player` prefab back to the hierarchy
- Open the `Player` **AnimationController**
- Open the Parameters tab and add a parameter of type **Trigger** called `playerChop`
- Add "to" and "from" transitions between PlayerIdle and PlayerHit and between PlayerIdle and PlayerChop
- On the transition to PlayerChop, disable **Has Exit Time** and set **Transition Offset** to `0`
  - Also add the trigger `playerChop`
- On the transition from PlayerChop back to PlayerIdle, set **Exit Duration** to `1` and **Transition Offset** to `0`
- Repeat the above two steps for the PlayerHit transitions

---

- Test that the above worked by:
  - Docking the **Animation** tab on the bottom of the editor
  - Playing the game
  - Clicking on each trigger in the **Parameters** list to manually trigger it
  - The respective animations should play

## Writing the Player Script

- Open the `GameManger` script
  - Add a field `public int playerFoodPoints` initialized to `100`
  - Add a field `[HideInInspector] public bool playersTurn` initialized to `true`
  - Add a method `public void GameOver()` that simply sets `enabled` to `false`
- Create and implement a Player script component
  - Note that instead of `Application.LoadLevel(Application.LoadedLevel);`, you should call `SceneManager.LoadScene (0);`
  - You'll need to add `using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;` at the top of the file
  - Add to the Player prefab
  - Set the script **Blocking Layer** to `BlockingLayer`

## Writing the Enemy Script

- Create and implement an Enemy script component

## Enemy Animator Controller

- Open the `Enemy` **AnimationController**
- Open the Parameters tab and add a parameter of type **Trigger** called `enemyAttack`
- Add "to" and "from" transitions between Enemy1Idle and Enemy1Attack
- On the transition to Enemy1Attack, disable **Has Exit Time** and set **Transition Offset** to `0`
  - Also add the trigger `enemyAttack`
- On the transition from Enemy1Attack back to Enemy1Idle, set **Exit Duration** to `1` and **Transition Offset** to `0`
- You can test the `Enemy` AnimationController in the same way we tested the `Player` AnimationController

---

- Open the `GameManager` script component
  - Add an enemy list and implement enemy movement

---

- Open the `Enemy` script
  - in the `Start()` method, call the `GameManager` method `AddEnemyToList()`
  - In the `OnCantMove()` method, call `animator.SetTrigger("enemyAttack");`
- Add the `Enemy` script to both enemy prefabs
  - Set the script **Blocking Layer** to `BlockingLayer`
  - Set the Player Damage of `Enemy1` to 10
  - Set the Player Damage of `Enemy2` to 20

## Adding UI & Level Transitions

- Create a UI &rarr; Canvas
- Create a UI &rarr; Image
  - Set the **Anchor** (including position, holding Alt or Option) to **stretch-stretch**
  - Set the **Color** to black
- Create a UI &rarr; Text and rename it to `LevelText`
  - Set the **Anchor** (including position, holding Alt or Option) to **center-center**
  - Set **Font** to `PressStart2P-Regular`
  - Set **Font Size** to `32`
  - Set both **Alignment** modes to middle
  - Set **Horizontal** and **Vertical Overflow** to `Overflow`
  - Set **Color** to white
  - Set **Text** to `Day 1`
- Copy the `LevelText` object and name the copy `FoodText`
  - Set the **Anchor** (including position, holding Alt or Option) to **bottom-center**
  - Set the **Anchor Min Y** to `0.05`
  - Set the **Anchor Max Y** to `0.05`
  - Set the **Pos Y** to `0`
  - Set **Font Size** to `24`
  - Set the **Text** to `Food 100`
- Move the `FoodText` above `LevelImage` in the list, and make `LevelText` a child of `LevelImage`

---

- Implement level loading and UI in the `GameManager` script
  - Note that with the current version of Unity, the `OnLevelWasLoaded` method will no longer work
    Instead, follow these steps:
  - Add `using UnityEngine.UI;` to the top of the file
  - Remove the `InitGame();` call from `Awake()`
  - Set the initial value of `level` to `0`
  - Add the following three methods:

```csharp
// This is called each time a scene is loaded.
void OnLevelFinishedLoading(Scene scene, LoadSceneMode mode)
{
    // Add one to our level number.
    level++;

    // Call InitGame to initialize our level.
    InitGame();
}

void OnEnable()
{
    // Tell our 'OnLevelFinishedLoading' function to start listening for a scene change event as soon as this script is enabled.
    SceneManager.sceneLoaded += OnLevelFinishedLoading;
}
void OnDisable()
{
    // Tell our 'OnLevelFinishedLoading' function to stop listening for a scene change event as soon as this script is disabled.
    // Remember to always have an unsubscription for every delegate you subscribe to!
    SceneManager.sceneLoaded -= OnLevelFinishedLoading;
}
```

- Implement UI elements in the `Player` script
- Back in the editor, initialize the `Food Text` field of the `Player` prefab

- The game should now be playable, but without sound
- The tutorial series continues on at this point to add sound effects and music, as well as mobile controls,
  but we're going to call it quits.
