Continue off of **Lab 2** for this assignment.

We will be following these video tutorials:

- [Collecting the Pick Up Objects](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial/collecting-pick-objects?playlist=17141)

- [Building the Game](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial/building-game?playlist=17141)

The written description for this lab should describe most of the steps,
but the videos go over a lot of tips and tricks and minor editor features.
I recommend watching the videos to do this lab!


## Step 1: Create Collectible Objects

- Create a cube and name it Pickup
  - Reduce the scale in all dimensions to 0.5
  - Set the rotation in all axis to 45 degrees
  - Raise it up 0.5 units on the Y axis

---

- Make the Pickup object animate with a rotation that changes every frame
  - Add a script component to the Pickup
  - In the Update() method, call the `Rotate` method on the object's `transform` to rotate the object every frame
  - Use a `new Vector3()` with different amounts for X, Y, and Z that are somewhere around 10 to 50.
  - Multiply (scale) this Vector3 by `Time.deltaTime` to make it so the animation occurs smoothly based on the framerate
  - E.g.: `transform.Rotate (new Vector3 (15, 30, 45) * Time.deltaTime);`

- Test to make sure the cube is spinning

- We want multiple pickups, so make a **Prefab** from this Pickup game object.
  - Make a `Prefabs` folder in the Project Window.
  - Drag the `Pickup` game object into this folder - this action (dragging a game object into the project assets location) creates a **Prefab**
  - Create an empty game object called `Pickups`
  - Make sure the parent object `Pickups` is at the origin (in the Inspector, click the gear to the right of Transform and select Reset)
  - Drag our first pickup object onto this parent object.
  - Copy and paste the `Pickup` object to create 12 objects and place them around the game space.

---

- Make the pickups a different color so they stand out.
  - Make a new material and change it's albedo to a bright color, like yellow.
  - Apply the material to one of the Pickup objects.
  - With that object selected, find "Prefab" in the Inspector View and click "Apply" - this applies the Prefab change to all objects with that Prefab.
  - All of your pickups should change color.

  - Alternatively, you can apply your material directly to the prefab (in the Project Window) to immediately affect all instances of the prefab.


## Step 2: Counting Points

- We want to remove the Pickups when they are hit by the player.
- First make it so that we can detect which objects are Pickups and which aren't.
  - Select the Pickup prefab and in the Inspector Window, click on Tag and select Add Tag...
  - Add a tag called "Pickup"
  - Go back to the Prefab and apply our new Tag.

- Use collider callbacks to remove Pickups when they are collided
  - Open the PlayerController script
  - Add a new method `void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)`
  - This event callback will be called when the player collider hits another collider
  - Check whether the collided object is a Pickup using `other.gameObject.CompareTag ("Pickup")`
  - If the object is a pickup, hide it using `other.gameObject.SetActive (false);`

- Playtest the game. What happens?

- The video has a more in-depth explanation of Unity physics, but what we need to do is change the Box Collider of our Prefab to a Trigger.
  - Either edit the Prefab directly, or make the change to one of the Pickup objects and apply it to the Prefab.
  - Under the Box Collider in the Inspector Window, select **Is Trigger**
  - While we're at it, let's optimize the physics of our Pickups
  - Add a RigidBody component to the prefab.
  - Under the RigidBody in the Inspector, check the **Is Kinematic** checkbox
  - This make's it so the picks are "dynamic" (Unity expects them to move, and handles them more efficiently) and "kinematic" (so that gravity and other forces do not affect them)
