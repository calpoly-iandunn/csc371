## Lab 2: Blueprint Lift Tutorial

I want you to do a tutorial from the documentation but it, like some of the tutorials on the website, is slightly out of date.
It uses an engine feature called **Matinee** that still exists, but has been deprecated in favor of a very similar feature called a **Level Sequence Asset**.

[https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Blueprint_Lift_Tutorial](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Blueprint_Lift_Tutorial)

You'll be able to follow the tutorial for the most part as is, but when it gets to the parts about the **Matinee** check here for how to do the equivalent action with a **Level Sequence Asset**.


- Instead of opening the class viewer to add the matinee, just click Cinematics --> Add Level Sequence above the Editor.
- You will create a new Level Sequence. Open it from the Content Browser to open the Sequencer.
- You do not need to create a group, just add the Actor to the Sequencer.
- You will not get a default keyframe at the start, you need to add one yourself (by pressing Enter).

Everything else should be the same or very similar.
A lot of using a big engine like Unreal is just figuring things our via intuition and trial/error, so this is a primer for that.
