Do the following tutorial.

[https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/UMG/QuickStart/index.html](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/UMG/QuickStart/index.html)

A couple of notes:

- Make sure to use `Set Show Mouse Cursor` on the `Player Controller` to make sure the cursor is visible on the main menu and pause menu, but not visible in the game.
- Pressing `Quit` from the pause menu should take you back to the main menu.

## Screenshots

If submitting this lab via screenshot, show me the FirstPersonCharacter and MainMenu blueprints.
