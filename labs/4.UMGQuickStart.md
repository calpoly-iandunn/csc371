A couple of notes:

<p class="text-danger"><strong>WARNING: On page 4, step 14, make sure to switch to the "Main" level before opening the Level Blueprint!!!</strong></p>

This is the most common cause of issues such as not being able to start the game.
Whichever level is visible in the viewport is the "current level" which will be started when you click the Play button.
When you select `Main` in the Content Browser, you should see a black screen since this level is empty.
Only when `Main` is the current level should you see the main menu when you press Play.
If you press Play while the `First Person Shooter Example Level` is visible, it should go straight into the game without showing the menu.
This is the only way to make the menu transitions work with this setup!

Other notes:

- Make sure to use `Set Show Mouse Cursor` on the `Player Controller` to make sure the cursor is visible on the main menu and pause menu, but not visible in the game.
- Pressing `Quit` from the pause menu should take you back to the main menu.
