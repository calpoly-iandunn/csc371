In this lab you will be following this video tutorial.

When you're done, I want you to add on to the tutorial by making it so that bullet impacts create an impulse on the hit component.
Also, adjust the crosshair so that it points at the right location (hint: in the FirstPersonHUD blueprint).

A couple of notes:

- In the latest version of Unreal Engine, the blueprint you are asked to modify (the FirstPersonCharacter blueprint) has some additional nodes.
  It has some nodes for Touch input and some nodes for VR input.
  You can safely ignore these nodes if you want to.
- In the latest Unreal, you need to use the Transform Component of the Player Camera Manager to get the Forward Vector.
  It will look like this.

- It's not called "Single Line Trace by Channel" anymore, now it's "LineTraceByChannel"
- You can add an impulse by taking the "Hit Component" from the Hit Result and creating a "Add Impulse At Location"
  If you use the "Impact Point" and "Impact Normal" as the "Location" and "Impulse" respectively, the box will fly back in the way you expect.
  You will need to multiply the "Impact Normal" by a very large negative number, though.
  I used `-1000000`.
- Adjust the crosshair so that it points at the right location (hint: in the FirstPersonHUD blueprint).
