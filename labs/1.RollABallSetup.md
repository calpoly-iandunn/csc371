## Part 1: Scene Setup

- Create a new project.
- Create a new scene.

- Create a 3D game object plane and name it `Ground`.
- Resize the plane to be twice as wide in the X and Z directions.
- Create a 3D sphere game object and name it `Player`.

- Create a new material with a dark color.
- Attach the new material to the ground object.

- Move the directional light Y direction to `60`


## Part 2: Moving the Player

- Create a **Rigid Body** component and attach it to the **Player** object.

- Create a script **New Script** component on our **Player** object.
- Move it to a folder called `Scripts` in the asset viewer.

- Open the script - it should open in either Visual Studio (Windows) or MonoDevelop (OS X, Linux).

- We need access to the `Rigidbody` component of this object, so let's make a variable to hold it:

```csharp
private Rigidbody rb;
```

- Initialize this variable in the `Start()` method using the `GetComponent<>` method:

```csharp
rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
```

- We are going to add some Physics code, so we're going to add a `void FixedUpdate()` method to this class.
- In the `FixedUpdate()` function, get some input from the player using the `Input` class and save it in some local variables:

```csharp
float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
```

- We want to move the player using these movement inputs. We can use the `Rigidbody.AddForce` function, but it requires a `Vector3`:

```csharp
Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveHorizontal, 0.0f, moveVertical);
rb.AddForce(movement);
```

- Go back to the Unity editor and press the <span class="oi oi-media-play"></span> button.
  You can use the **WASD** buttons to move the ball, or an attached gamepad controller.

- If we try this out, we'll see that the ball moves pretty slowly.
  Let's go back to the script and add a way to change the speed of the ball.
- First, add a `public float speed;` to the class.
- Now, use this variable to control the force added to the Rigidbody:

```csharp
rb.AddForce(movement * speed);
```
