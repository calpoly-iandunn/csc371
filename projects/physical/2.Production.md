We will now work on board game production, then playtesting each other's games.

## Writeup

I want each team to submit a writeup describing their production phase.
I'm looking for at least a few pages here.
Be descriptive!


### Rubric

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Points</th>
      <th>Content</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td markdown="block">
**Production Details**
* Any changes you have made to the game since your physical prototype.
* Any changes in mechanics? Rules?
* Additional content including cards or units (e.g. Features)?
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td markdown="block">
**Playesting Details**
* Observations made during your playtesting session
* Anything you were particularily looking for or testing for in your playtesting
* Definitely any test control situations you set up
* If you have them, a list of any few questions you prepared for your production playtest session (see p. 263 in the book)
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td markdown="block">
**Project Wrapup**
* What changes would you make if you had more time?
* Anything you wish you had done differently from the start?
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td markdown="block">
**Project Assets**
* I would also appreciate if you attach any assets from your production (such as document containing printed cards, etc.)
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td markdown="block">
**Formatting and spelling**
- No, or few, spelling, grammar, mistakes
- Clear use of structure like section headings, lists, paragraphs
- No walls of text
</td>
</tr>

## Hand-in

I recommend using Google Docs or a similar platform so that everyone on the team can contribute easily.

Please send your writeup to me via email, or give me read access (share it) if it's on a platform like Google Docs.
Plain text, an attachment, or a link to the document are all fine.
See the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/) page for the due date.
