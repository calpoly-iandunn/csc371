## Project 1: Physical Game

Work in teams of 1-6 to create a physical/conventional game such as a board game, trading-card game, or pen-and-paper RPG.

In this project we will consider some of the more pure aspects of game design, doing lots of prototyping and playtesting.
The advantage of a physical game is that the iteration time in terms of making design changes can be quite short.
When making digital games, you acquire a lot of technical debt and there can be huge development hurdles when making changes.

### Deliverables:

1. [Prototyping](physical/1/) due {{ site.data.assignments['physical/1'].due }}.

2. [Production](physical/2/) due {{ site.data.assignments['physical/2'].due }}.



## Project 2: Digital Game

Work in teams of 1-6 to create a digital game using Unity.

[GitHub Classroom Repositories can be created here.](https://classroom.github.com/g/Xu2s6yg3)

Once our conventional games are complete, we will move on to digital games.
Digital games often have a more complicated development process,
as both the gameplay aspects as well as the technology must be implemented.

You can make a 2D, 2.5D, or 3D game.
Networking is possible in Unity, but makes the development process more complicated.
Splitscreen is a reasonable alternative if multiplayer functionality is desired.

### Deliverables:

1. [Physical Prototype](digital/1/) due {{ site.data.assignments['digital/1'].due }}.

2. [Digital Prototype](digital/2/) due {{ site.data.assignments['digital/2'].due }}.

3. [Production](digital/3/) (completed in three sprints with individual due-dates).

4. [Design Document](digital/4/) due {{ site.data.assignments['digital/4'].due }}.

5. [Team Evaluations](digital/5/) due {{ site.data.assignments['digital/5'].due }}.
