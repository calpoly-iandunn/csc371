## Project 1: Physical Game

Work in teams of 1-6 to create a physical/conventional game such as a board game, trading-card game, or pen-and-paper RPG.

In this project we will consider some of the more pure aspects of game design, doing lots of prototyping and playtesting.
The advantage of a physical game is that the iteration time in terms of making design changes can be quite short.
When making digital games, you acquire a lot of technical debt and there can be huge development hurdles when making changes.

### Deliverables:

1. [Prototyping](physical/1/) due {{ site.data.assignments['physical/1'].due }}.

2. [Production](physical/2/) due {{ site.data.assignments['physical/2'].due }}.



## Project 2: Digital Game

  <strong>Warning:</strong> Due-dates have not been updated for the digital game project.
  The write-up requirements will also be changing.

Work in teams of 2-6 to create a digital game using Unity.

Once our conventional games are complete, we will move on to digital games.
Digital games often have a more complicated development process,
as both the gameplay aspects as well as the technology must be implemented.

You can make a 2D, 2.5D, or 3D game.
Networking is possible in Unity, but makes the development process more complicated.
Splitscreen is a reasonable alternative if multiplayer functionality is desired.

### Deliverables:

1. [Physical Prototyping](digital/1/) due Wednesday 5/10.

2. [Software Prototyping](digital/2/) due Friday 5/19.

3. [Production](digital/3/) (completed in four sprints with individual due-dates).

4. [Design Document](digital/4/) due Friday 6/9.

5. [Team Evaluations](digital/5/) due Wednesday 6/14.
